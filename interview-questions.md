# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is JSX? What is one syntax difference between HTML and JSX?

Your answer:JSX is the combination of HTML and Javascript in order to create a user interface for users to interact with. Javascript usually has to be linked in to an HTML file in order for the code to work as intended. The syntax difference is that to reference code for Javascript in an JSX file is to surround it in curly braces while for an HTML page it is has the Javascript file attached.

Researched answer: JSX is an acronym within an acronym which is javascript XML leading to javascript extensive markup language. It is able to use parts of HTML in Javascript converting it into react elements. In HTML, tags can only be used to signify header , footer, etc. JSX is able to have a variable be assigned to the tags as a value. For an example, const hello = <h1>Hello</h1> is JSX, while <h1>Hello</h1> is just html.

2. What is yarn? What file(s) are modified in a React application when you run the command yarn in your terminal?

Your answer:I cannot recall the acronym that yarn stands for however I do know that it is a package manager allowing the user to install the necessary files for code to run on a webpage. It adds files such as a json file. They are the dependencies required to run the code.

Researched answer: Yarn is an acronym for yet another resource negotiator. It was made by developers out of humor. Yarn modifies the yarn.lock file depending on whether it satifies the dependicies required in package.json. Installing the newest versions to yarn.lock. 

3. What is an anonymous function in JavaScript?

Your answer: An anonymous function is one with an empty parentheses and curly braces. It is to signify a higher order function is being created in order for it to operate correctly encompassing a lot of logic into a shorthanded form.

Researched answer: It is a function with no name assigned to it. It is often used to pass arguments into other functions. After the anonymous function is made, a variable can only access it as a value.

4. What is the difference between state values and props in React?

Your answer: State values are the values saved and updated between the DOM and the Virtual DOM. The Virtual DOM checks changes in the code and updates the DOM or what the user sees accordingly. State however is not saved once the page refreshes. Depends on the code for the state. Props are shorthand for properties. They are given to functions to incorporate other values into the function.

Researched answer: State values are the property values for the object state which is a built in object for React. Props are shorthand for properties. They are used to pass arguments in React components. They used HTML attributes to pass into React components.

5. What is the DOM? 

Your answer:I cannot recall the acronym for DOM. I did reference the DOM and Virtual DOM in my question about state values and props in React. The DOM allows us to see the user interface as designed by the code. The Virtual DOM will check the DOM to see if any changes occurred and will update the DOM accordingly without refreshing the webpage.


Researched answer: DOM is an acronym for Document Object Model. It is used as an application programming interface for HTML and XML documents. Programmers are able to access the information within the documents and make changes accordingly. It is used as a standard programming interface.

6. STRETCH: Which is the difference between a div and a span?

Your answer: A div is shorthand for division within the page. It is used to state a separation of spaces. A span is a space within the page. 

Researched answer: A div is used to dictate a division or section in an HTML document. A span is used to wrap or add attributes to section of text. It however does not create a new line break like the div tag does. A line break is always placed before and after a div tag.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Object-oriented programming: It is a programming model that focuses more on objects rather than functions.

2. Ruby: A programming language that is dynamic and focused on productivity and simplicity

3. Implicit return: The last line of every block will return automatically in Ruby.

4. Ruby blocks: A chunk of code that can be assigned a name in ruby

5. Ruby hashes: A collection of key pairs similar to an array but using keys an an index instead of integers
